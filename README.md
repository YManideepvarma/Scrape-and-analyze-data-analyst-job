# Job Scraper Project

## Overview
This Python script scrapes job postings from a sample job site and saves them in a structured CSV file. It's built to help recruitment agencies gather data efficiently and stay ahead in job sourcing.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- BeautifulSoup (for HTML parsing)
- requests (to fetch webpage content)
- csv (to write data into CSV file)

## Setup
1. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
python job_scraper.py
```

3. Output:
A `job_postings.csv` file will be generated with job titles, companies, locations, posted dates, and apply links.

## Business Impact
This tool enables faster job data collection from websites, empowering recruitment teams to act quickly and reduce manual overhead. It can be further extended to scrape from multiple job sites.
